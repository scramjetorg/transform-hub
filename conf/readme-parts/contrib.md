## Contributions

We accept valid contributions and we will be publishing a more specific project roadmap so contributors can propose features and also help us implement them. We kindly ask you that contributed commits are Signed-Off `git commit --sign-off`.

We provide support for contributors via test cases. If you expect a certain type of workflow to be officially supported, please specify and implement a test case in `Gherkin` format in `bdd` directory and include it in your pull request. More info about our BDD test you will find [here](../../bdd/README.md).
