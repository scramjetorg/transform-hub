    Thanks for using Scramjet Transform Hub. This hub is set to report the anonymous usage statistics to the authors so issues can be identified quicker and usage can be improved. We do not send any specific data about your system, no specific hardware specs or software specs.

    You can read more about the reports in the source code here: https://github.com/scramjetorg/transform-hub/tree/v0.27.1/packages/types/telemetry.ts

    If you're unhappy with this, you can switch off the telemetry, by restarting the hub with \`--no-telemetry\` option. Be aware however that the developers will be very sad if you do so and you don't want to make the developers sad, do you?
