This package provides a CLI interface to communicate with Scramjet Transform Hub. You can install the CLI like this:

```bash
npm install -g @scramjet/cli
```

Once installed, the CLI is available as the command `si` or `scramjet-interface`:

```md
Usage: si [options...] | si [command] [options...]

General options

* `-L, --log-level <level>  Specify log level (default: "trace")`
* `-a, --api-url <url>      Specify base API url (default: "http://localhost:8000/api/v1")`
* `-f, --format <value>     Specify display formatting: json or pretty (default: "pretty")`
* `-h, --help               display help for command`

Commands

* `pack [options]`
* `host [command]           something`
* `config, c [command]       configuration file operations`
* `sequence, seq [command]   operations on sequence`
* `instance, inst [command]  operations on instance`
* `help [command]           display help for command`

Show sequence and instance help by providing --help option after each.
```

### Set up config

Set STH url:

```bash
si config apiUrl "http://url.to.host:8000"
```

See the current config (including default values):

```bash
> si config print
```

## Create a package

Usage: `si pack [options] <directory>`

Options:

* `-c, --stdout                output to stdout (ignores -o)`
* `-o, --output <file.tar.gz>  output path - defaults to dirname`
* `-h, --help                  display help for command`

## Sequence operations

```bash
si seq run [options] [package] [args...] # Uploads a package and immediately executes it with given arguments
si seq send [<sequencePackage>]          # send packed and compressed sequence file
si seq list|ls                           # list the sequences
si seq start [options] <id> [args...]    # start the sequence
si seq get <id>                          # get data about the sequence
si seq delete|rm <id>                    # delete the sequence
si seq help [command]                    # display help for command
```

## Instance operations

```bash
si inst list|ls                                       # list the instances
si inst kill <id>                                     # kill instance without waiting for unfinished tasks
si inst stop <id> <timeout>                           # end instance gracefully waiting for unfinished tasks
si inst status <id>                                   # status data about the instance
si inst health <id>                                   # show the instance health status
si inst info <id>                                     # show info about the instance
si inst invokeEvent|emit <id> <eventName> [<payload>] # send event with eventName and a JSON formatted event payload
si inst event|on [options] <id> <event>               # get the last event occurrence (will wait for the first one if not yet retrieved)
si inst input <id> [<file>]                           # send file to input, if file not given the data will be read from stdin
si inst output <id>                                   # show stream on output
si inst log <id>                                      # show instance log
si inst attach <id>                                   # connect to all stdio - stdin, stdout, stderr of a running instance
si inst stdin <id> [<file>]                           # send file to stdin, if file not given the data will be read from stdin
si inst stderr <id>                                   # show stream on stderr
si inst stdout <id>                                   # show stream on stdout
si inst help [command]                                # display help for command
```

## Scramjet Transform Hub

This package is part of [Scramjet Transform Hub](https://www.npmjs.org/package/@scramjet/sth).

Scramjet Transform Hub is a deployment and execution platform. Once installed on a server, it will allow you to start your programs and keep them running on a remote machine. You will be able to start programs in the background or connect to them and see their output directly on your terminal. You will be able to pipe your local data to the program as if it was running from your terminal. You can start your server in AWS, Google Cloud or Azure, start it on your local machine, install it on a Raspberry Pi or wherever else you'd like.

## Use cases

There's no limit what you can use it for. You want a stock checker? A chat bot? Maybe you'd like to automate your home? Retrieve sensor data? Maybe you have a lot of data and want to transfer and wrangle it? You have a database of cities and you'd like to enrich your data? You do machine learning and you want to train your set while the data is fetched in real time? Hey, you want to use it for something else and ask us if that's a good use? Ask us [via email](mailto:get@scramjet.org) or hop on our [Scramjet Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/scramjetframework/shared_invite/enQtODg2MDIyMTQ5MzUxLTVlNTIwMmFlYWU0YTg2ZTg1YmFiOTZkZTdhNzNmNjE2ZmQ3ZWQzZjI5MGQyZDAyOWM2NDc5YzdmZGQzNGI3YTU)!
