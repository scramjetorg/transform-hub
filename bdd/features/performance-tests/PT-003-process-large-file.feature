    Scenario: PT-003 TC-001 Sequence processes file smaller than accesible RAM
        Given host is running
        When sequence "../packages/reference-apps/big-file-sequence.tar.gz" loaded
        And instance started with url from assets argument "scp-store/small-file.json.gz"
        And get "output" with instanceId and wait for it to finish
        When response data is equal "95"
        Then host is still running
