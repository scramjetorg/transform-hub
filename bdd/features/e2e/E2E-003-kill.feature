    Scenario: E2E-003 TC-001 Kill instance
        Given host is running
        When sequence "../packages/reference-apps/hello-alice-out.tar.gz" loaded
        And wait for "4000" ms
        And instance started with arguments "/package/data.json"
        And wait for "5000" ms
        When get instance health
        And get containerId
        And instance health is "true"
        And send kill message to instance
        And wait for "8000" ms
        And container is closed
        Then host is still running

    # This is a potential edge case so it's currently ignored.

        Given host is running
        When sequence "../packages/reference-apps/sequence-20s-kill-handler.tar.gz" loaded

        And get containerId
        And instance health is "true"
        Then get event "kill-handler-called" from instance
        When send kill message to instance
