        Then I start Sequence with options "--output-topic names3"
        Then I send input data "topic test input" with options "--end"
        When I execute CLI with "seq send ../packages/reference-apps/python-topic-consumer.tar.gz" arguments
        Then I get Sequence id
        Then I start Sequence with options "--input-topic names3"
        And I get Instance output without waiting for the end
        Then confirm data named "python-topics" will be received
        And host is still running
