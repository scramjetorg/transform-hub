Scramjet Transform Hub is a deployment and execution platform. Once installed on a server, it will allow you to start your programs and keep them running on a remote machine. You will be able to start programs in the background or connect to them and see their output directly on your terminal. You will be able to pipe your local data to the program as if it was running from your terminal. You can start your server in AWS, Google Cloud or Azure, start it on your local machine, install it on a Raspberry Pi or wherever else you'd like.

## TL;DR

Install and start the hub, copy the following commands to the terminal:

```bash
npm i -g @scramjet/sth @scramjet/cli
scramjet-transform-hub
```

Depending on your machine this may take some time. When it's done the Hub should be running and you should see initial logs showing that the API server has been started on port 8000, something like this:

```shell
$ scramjet-transform-hub
2022-08-18T07:55:13.135Z INFO  Host Log Level [ 'TRACE' ]
2022-08-18T07:55:13.137Z TRACE Host Host main called [ { version: '0.27.0' } ]
2022-08-18T07:55:13.155Z INFO  Host Will use the "docker" adapter for running Sequences
2022-08-18T07:55:13.157Z INFO  SocketServer SocketServer on [ { address: '::', family: 'IPv6', port: 8001 } ]
2022-08-18T07:55:13.159Z INFO  Host API on [ '0.0.0.0:8000' ]
2022-08-18T07:55:13.160Z INFO  Host You don't need to maintain your own server anymore [
  {
    'Check out': 'Scramjet Cloud Platform',
    here: 'https://scr.je/join-beta-sth'
  }
]

```

Now create an application, let's say you want to get the currency rates every 10 seconds and do something. This example below simply prints out the actual cryptocurrency price in the desired currency. Both the cryptocurrency and the currency we want to check the price in are passed to the sequence as arguments.

In a clean folder save this as `index.js`:

```js
const { DataStream } = require("scramjet");
const fetch = require("node-fetch");

module.exports = function(_stream, fr, to) {
    const defer = (t = 10000) => new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, t));
    const get = () => fetch(`https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/${fr}-${to}/spot`).then((res) => res.json());

    return DataStream
        .from(async function*() {
            while (true)
                yield await Promise.all([get(), defer()]).then(([data]) => data);
        })
        .do((x) => console.log(`Actual ${fr} cryptocurrency price is ${x.data.amount} ${to}`)) // add some logic here
        .run();
};
```

Copy a content below and save it as `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "@scramjet/currency-js",
  "version": "0.12.2",
  "main": "index.js",
  "author": "Scramjet <open-source@scramjet.org>",
  "license": "GPL-3.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "node-fetch": "^2.6.1",
    "scramjet": "^4.36.0"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/scramjetorg/transform-hub.git"
  }
}
```

Keep your hub running in one terminal. Open another terminal and follow the steps to run your program on the hub:

```bash
# go to the folder with the app
cd /path/to/my/folder

# install dependencies
npm install

# compress the app to a `tar.gz` package
si seq pack . -o ~/app.tar.gz

# upload the compressed app package to the transform-hub
si seq send ~/app.tar.gz
# <sequence-id> will be returned

# start the program on the transform-hub with arguments
si seq start <sequence-id> --args [\"BTC\",\"EUR\"]

# alternatively - param will send the last packaged sequence
si seq start - --args [\"BTC\",\"EUR\"]
# <instance-id> will be returned

# see the output from the program by reading the stdout stream
si inst stdout <instance-id>

# alternatively use - param instead of <instance-id>
si inst stdout -

# expected output
Actual BTC currency price is 23128.42 EUR
Actual BTC currency price is 23124.8 EUR
```

See `si help` for more information.

## The basics

Scramjet Transform Hub allows you to deploy and execute programs that you build and develop. As mentioned above, you can run any program you like, but you need to know a couple of important things:

* The program should consist of a function or an array of functions, such a program is called a **Transform Sequence**.
* The sequence will be executed within a separate docker instance (we're working on other execution environment integrations - help will be appreciated).
* The sequence function will receive a stream as input in the first argument - you can send the data to it via the command `si instance input`.
* If your sequence contains more than one function, then the output from the previous one is passed to the next one. The first function in sequence receives the input from API.
* The last (or the only) function in sequence can return a `Promise` or a `Stream` - based on this, STH will know when processing is done.
* Once the returned `Promise` is resolved, or the `Stream` is ended, STH will gracefully stop the sequence and remove its container.
* You can communicate with the server via API, command line client `si` which we wrote for your convenience.
* The sequence is called with an AppContext as `this`, a class that allows you to communicate back from the sequence: send logs, provide health info, send and receive events from the API or CLI.
* You can run your sequence multiple times with different arguments (like for instance currency tickers with different symbols or sensor data readers for each sensor)
* The program does not leave your server and doesn't use any external systems. It runs on the server you install the host on.
* Currently STH supports node.js runner only, we're working on bringing you runners for other languages, with Python and C++ as the first ones.

## Use cases

There's no limit what you can use it for. You want a stock checker? A chat bot? Maybe you'd like to automate your home? Retrieve sensor data? Maybe you have a lot of data and want to transfer and wrangle it? You have a database of cities and you'd like to enrich your data? You do machine learning and you want to train your set while the data is fetched in real time? Hey, you want to use it for something else and ask us if that's a good use? Ask us [via email](mailto:get@scramjet.org) or hop on our [Scramjet Discord](https://scr.je/join-community-mg1)!
