## Introduction

**Stream protocol** is used to communicate and push data through Cloud Server Instance (STH). Streams are piped to proper communication channel, which are grouped (multiplexed) as interleaved data packets to travel from Host to Runner. All the communication takes place thanks to `CommunicationHandler` class.

**Cloud Server Host** on initialization of a new Sequence and a Sequence Instance based on passed parameters, like: `package stream`, `application config` (package.json) and `sequence arguments`, creates `downstream` and `upstream`. Both arrays of streams are hooked (hookUpstreamStreams, hookDownstreamStreams, hookLogStream) to proper communication channel.

Next it pipes monitor stream from host and from runner so that both can talk to each other. Communication starts from a handshake. Runner sends ping to say 'Hello there', a host sends back pong saying 'Hi, I'm ready to talk'.

At the end of its initiation CSH creates `Net Server` and `Api Server`.

## Type of streams

| STREAM  | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                          |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| stdin   | process.stdin                                                                                                                        |
| stdout  | process.stdout                                                                                                                       |

| control | Used for sending events like: kill, stop, etc. and info about sequence configuration.                                                |
| monitor | Contains all information about a sequence like description, status, feedback from all performed operations, etc.                     |
| pkg     | Contains sequence stream with a config file which is sent to the runner.                                                             |
| input   | An optional input stream transporting data for processing to the Sequence.                                                           |
| output  | An optional output stream transporting data processed by the Sequence, piped to runner - if none passed, `this.stdout` will be used. |
| log     | Log channel is for all kinds of log messages not only for development purposes but also for messages defined in sequence.            |

Streams can be managed by user via cURL. Example:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/type_xx" localhost:8000/api/v1/xxx/
```

CMD options that good to know:

- -H (`--header`): `<header/@file>` pass custom header(s) to server
- -d (`--data`): `<data>` HTTP POST data
- -X POST (`--request`): `<POST>` specify POST when there is no data provided `-d`
- -X GET (`--request`): `<GET>` specify GET, if no data provided `-d` GET is default
- -v (`--verbose`): make the operation more talkative
- `jq` - JSON formatting to read data by human.

```bash
sudo apt-get install jq
```

[Check out more about ./jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/)

To send a package use below command (stream pkg).

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" --data-binary "@home/user/package.tar.gz" http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sequence -v
```

or

```bash
SEQ_ID=$( \
    curl -H 'content-type: application/octet-stream' \
    --data-binary '@packages/reference-apps/hello-alice-out.tar.gz' \
    "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sequence" | jq ".id" -r \
)
```

As a response the `sequence_id` will be received. Copy it and use to start the sequence via command:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sequence/:id/start -v
```

or in the other way with params (no need to copy):

```bash
INSTANCE_ID=$(curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data-raw '{"appConfig": {},"args": ["/package/data.json"]}' \
http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sequence/$SEQ_ID/start | jq ".id" -r)
```

To check all uploaded sequences run in CMD:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8000/api/v1/sequences/ -v
```

In a response JSON object will be displayed. Response example:

```json
{
  "va+RikUw+2u23ZtPH2fPenB1mSoxSOrl": {
    "id": "va+RikUw+2u23ZtPH2fPenB1mSoxSOrl",
    "config": {
      "image": "scramjetorg/runner:0.10.0",
      "version": "",
      "engines": {
        "node": ">=10",
        "scramjet": ">=0.9"
      },
      "sequencePath": "index",
      "packageVolumeId": "d33cf047628a03d403318f58462ac25a537aeaa94a49ec7505324b352d7ab80a"
    }
  }
}
```

You can also check all running instances. In a response JSON object will be displayed.

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8000/api/v1/instances/ -v
```

Send additional input:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" --data-binary "@home/user/test.txt" http://localhost:8000/api/v1/stream/input -v
```

Check the output:

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/instance/$INSTANCE_ID/stdout" \
```
