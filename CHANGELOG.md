New features:

- **Topics** - You can now send data to STH without having to have a sequence
- **Cloud Platform Connection** - Scramjet will allow to connect multiple STH to allow multipoint data sharing between them
- **New Adapters** - New adapters added to instance and sequence which doesn't depend on Docker
- **Log endpoint** - New endpoint '/logs' that streams all instances logs
- **Verser module** - New module for reverse server functionality
- **Comments** - Improved code documentation
- **TCP Runner** - Connection between Runner and Host is replaced from socket to TCP
- **CLI extension** - Last uploaded/added sequence can now be referenced when starting etc. This will massively improve the CLI experience, as there's no longer need to parse the previous command line if we want to do quick deployment of a sequence
- **Python runner WIP** - Running STH without docker can now spawn sequences written in python
- **HTTPS Upgrade** - The API server can now be secured using HTTPS
- **Instance stop improvement** - Support for graceful stop of Instance in Python Runner
- **Typed responses for api-client** - Integrate sapphire fetch wrapper in api-cli
- **Python Runner BDD tests** - Introduce BDD tests for Python Runner
- **PYTHONPATH** - Configured PYTHONPATH for loading dependencies
- **Python Instance events** - Handle Instance events in Python Runner
- **Kubernetes Runtime Adapters** - new Sequence and Instance Adapters allow running programs on Kubernetes
- **Dockerized Python Runner** - Python programs can now be run in Docker containers

Bugfixes and minor improvements:

- Fix for spawning runner process
- Container close issues now show not occur
- Introduced fixes that close
- Improved test stability
- Improved Github Actions workflows
- Fix for Service Discovery, where API endpoint '/input' is not blocking after the second PANG message.
- Verify if package exists before sending it to STH
- Fix for STH version unknown from response API endpoint '/version'
- Add missing import in packages/types/sth-rest-api/src/index.ts.
- Fix for dependencies in sth/package.json, types/package.json and bdd/package.json
- Change default STH host from localhost to 0.0.0.0
- Fix for Runner output when output stream is in `{ objectMode: true }`
- Fix for CLI when input is provided from command line
- Fix for log duplication
- Fix process.stdin ending
- Fix STH to be able to run from within a docker container (bugged since 0.13 and TCP Runner)
- STH is able to reconnect to Scramjet Cloud Platform automatically
- Fix for the id replacement in CLI.
- Improved chunk size handling for the input and controls streams in the Python Runner
