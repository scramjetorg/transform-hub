New features:

- **Topics** - You can now send data to STH without having to have a Sequence
- **Cloud Platform Connection** - Scramjet will allow to connect multiple STH to allow multipoint data sharing between them
- **New Adapters** - New adapters added to Instance and Sequence which doesn't depend on Docker
- **Log endpoint** - New endpoint '/logs' that streams all Instances logs
- **Verser module** - New module for reverse server functionality
- **Comments** - Improved code documentation
- **TCP Runner** - Connection between Runner and Host is replaced from socket to TCP
- **CLI extension** - Last uploaded/added Sequence can now be referenced when starting etc. This will massively improve the CLI experience, as there's no longer need to parse the previous command line if we want to do quick deployment of a Sequence
- **Python runner WIP** - Running STH without docker can now spawn Sequences written in python
- **HTTPS Upgrade** - The API server can now be secured using HTTPS
- **Instance stop improvement** - Support for graceful stop of Instance in Python Runner
- **Typed responses for api-client** - Integrate sapphire fetch wrapper in api-cli
- **Python Runner BDD tests** - Introduce BDD tests for Python Runner
- **PYTHONPATH** - Configured PYTHONPATH for loading dependencies
- **Python Instance events** - Handle Instance events in Python Runner
- **Kubernetes Runtime Adapters** - new Sequence and Instance Adapters allow running programs on Kubernetes
- **Dockerized Python Runner** - Python programs can now be run in Docker containers
- **Reusable topics** - Topic streams don't end when input ends, you can always send more input
- **Python in Docker image** - When running STH from docker image, you will have python installed to run python Sequences inside
- **Infrastructure as Code mode** - allow configuring Sequences that should be started automatically when STH is started.
- **Audit stream** - Adds middleware to Host API Server to intercept all requests and push their details to Audit stream.
- **API client** in Python (basic implemantation).
- **Resource limits** for runner pod in kubernetes adapter.
- **Runner crashlog** - logs from a crashed runner should be available in host, even if the runner crashed before connecting.
